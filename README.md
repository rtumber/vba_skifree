SkiFree adaptation written using VBA for MS Excel on Windows

Released with Microsoft Entertainment Pack 3 for Windows and DOS in 1991, SkiFree is a top down sports simulation game.
This is an adaptation written using VBA for MS Excel on Windows (64 bit) and could be described as being entirely frivolous or simply a learning exercise.
In either case, an attempt is made to recreate full funtionality, though an exact copy should not be expected due to limitations in the language used and missing information on the original specifications.

To use, copy the xlsm and complete assets folder to a parent folder, retaining the current structure.   

Known issues:
  - Typing stops the macro and I've not yet determined the best approach to remedy this. 
  - Replicating the mouse positioning found in the original - all methods tested so far have shown significant detrimental impact on macro performance to the extent where at this     time this functionality has been stopped to perhaps look at again down the line.
