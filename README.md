SkiFree adaptation written using VBA for MS Excel on Windows

Released with Microsoft Entertainment Pack 3 for Windows and DOS in 1991, SkiFree is a top down sports simulation game.
This is an adaptation written using VBA for MS Excel on Windows (64 bit) and could be described as being entirely frivolous or simply a learning exercise.
In either case, an attempt is made to recreate full funtionality, though an exact copy should not be expected due to limitations in the language used and missing information on the original specifications.
